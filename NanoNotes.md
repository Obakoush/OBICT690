# Topic 3.2 Notes // Using Nano Text Editor
**General Notes**
- Open terminal and type nano to start 
- Menu at bottom of screen, may need to use diff keys for mac
- Alternatives: tilde, micro, traditional editors (ed(1), Vi/Vim, Emacs)
- This week: mess around more with nano and try tilde, note down here which prefered 

**Overview of Nano**
- Nano text editor was super easy to use and figure out. I look foward to the future weeks where we use it more. 
- I think I will make it a priority to try tilde so I can see which I prefer and utilize that for the semester.
